  Hello, my name is Yanga Lomuro. Last year I graduated with a degree in Bsc Mathematics and looking to find a future in tech.
  To become a higly competent coder, for the world of tech is getting bigger by the day and would like to play my part. Apart from my career aspirations 
  I am an ethusiast of all football , ususally . A 
  lover of the beautioful game that is football, you may see may try to ping a pass across the length of the pitch or trying to hike across nature. I have 
  been apart of camping events and their typical day to day running.
